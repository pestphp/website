# Watch Plugin

The Watch plugin for Pest keeps an eye on your `tests/` folder and automatically run your Pest tests on file change.

Follow these two steps to install it:

1. [**Install fswatch**](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch#getting-fswatch) on your machine, or check if you already have it:

```bash
fswatch --version
```

2. Install the Watch plugin using Composer:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-watch --dev
```


This will add a new option to your Pest CLI so you can start watching any updates on your `tests/` folder.

**Just start Pest with the following command:**

```bash
pest --watch # Night gathers, and now my watch begins
```
