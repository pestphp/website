# Plugins

Plugins can extend Pest's functionality and are easy to write.

## Setting up the plugin template

To create your own plugin, it's easiest to start with the [pest-plugin-template](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-template).
To create a new repository from it click on the "Use this template" button. Call it `pest-plugin-<yourpluginname>`. 

Now clone the new repository to work on your plugin.

Edit `composer.json` and adjust the fields `name` and `description` to fit your plugin.

## Adding global functions

A plugin may integrate additional functions. These may be even external
libraries, added to the global space. A good example is the [Faker plugin](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-faker), 
which we are going to reproduce here. 

If your plugin has any dependencies, then add them first with `composer`:

```bash
composer require fzaninotto/faker
```

All plugin files reside inside the `src/` folder. Let's assume we want to provide a `faker()` method
for our tests. We create a file `InteractsWithFaker.php` with the following code:

```php
if (!function_exists('faker')) {
    /** @phpstan-ignore-next-line */
    function faker(string $locale = null): Faker\Generator
    {
        return Faker\Factory::create($locale ?? Faker\Factory::DEFAULT_LOCALE);
    }
}
```

This provides a `fake()` method inside our tests, by creating an object and returning it. 
Now we can use `Faker` directly and easily in our tests: 

```php
it('doing something with faker', function() ) {
    assertIsString(faker()->name);
}
```

Before our `faker()` method is available though, we must ensure it is always loaded.

To load our extension, we must add or adjust the `autoload` section in the `composer.json` to point to the files we want to load:
```json
...
    "autoload": {
        "files": ["src/InteractsWithFaker.php"]
    },
...
```
Any amount of further files can be added this way. They will be loaded automatically.

The `Plugin.php` file from the template is only required when adding functionality as explained 
in the following section, and can be safely deleted otherwise.

## Adding Higher Order methods

Methods can also be added for higher order tests. 

We are going to add a trait and tell Pest to use it. We are going to call our imaginery plugin `MyPlugin`. 
For writing your own plugin, choice your own name and make sure you adjust all occurences in the following code.

First, let's create our trait as `src/MyPluginTrait.php`:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Pest\PluginMyPlugin;

trait MyPluginTrait
{
    public function visitHomePage()
    {
        return $this->get('/')
                    ->assertSee('Welcome');
    }
    
    public function actOnProfilePage()
    {
        $user = factory(User::class)->create();
        return actingAs($user)->get('/profile')->assertSee($user->name);
    }
}
```

Make sure, you always return the object, so high order functionality isn't broken.

This will allow us to write tests like this:
```php
it('has a homepage')->visitHomePage()
    ->actOnProfilePage()
    ->assertTrue(true);
```

To make the functionality available, we need to let Pest know that it should use it. We will do this in `Plugin.php`:

```php
use Pest\PluginMyPlugin\MyPluginTrait;

Pest\Plugin::uses(MyPluginTrait::class);
```

And finally, we have to load the files. We adjust our `composer.json` as following, to reference our namespace 
for PSR-4 autoloading and tell it to load and run our `Plugin.php`:

```json
    ...
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Pest\\PluginMyPlugin\\": "src/"
        },
        "files": ["src/Plugin.php"]
    },
    ...
```

## Tips & Tricks

To access the current test case in your plugin, you can use `test()`.

`$this` is also available, as you would use it inside `function() {}` in your tests.


## Testing and submitting your plugin

It is possible to add tests to your plugin in the same way you would 
otherwise. Read the `README.MD` in the plugin template for more information.
